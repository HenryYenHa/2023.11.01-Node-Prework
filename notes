Window and document keyword does not exist in Node.

Node is a runtime environment using the V8 (Chrome's) compiler of JS.

setTimeOut, setInterval and console are technically part of window but it is available on Node as well.
Instead you call global.
Ex: 
global.console.log("Message here");

but simply typing:
console.log("....");
is entirely acceptable.

Exporting variables and functions as they are often private:

module.exports.log = log;

Would export a variable/function called "log". 

module.exports.endPoint = URL;

Would export a variable/function called URL on ourside and on the user side would eb called "endPoint".
